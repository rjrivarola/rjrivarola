## About me

I'm Rodrigo Rivarola. I recently graduated from the University of Chicago's [Master in Computational analysis and Public Policy](https://capp.uchicago.edu/). Before this I worked in economic research and data science at The World Bank, and public sector consulting with government agencies and international development organizations.

## Code samples
- [Apartments Plus](https://github.com/uchicago-capp-30320/apt-plus) (2025 | Python, JavaScript): [Apartments Plus](https://aptpl.us/) aggregates data that mainstream rental sites often do not display, such as building defects, grocery stores and bus stops availability. My contributions to this project as GIS frontend specialist were developing the map features and functionality.
- [Qhapac-Nan](https://github.com/macs30123-s24/final-project-qhapac_nan) (2025 | Python): Project to explore geospatial determinants of the Qhapac-Ã‘an road. I use AWS and a dask cluster to run more than 100 models using a 11 million observations geospatial dataset, produce summary statistics and visualizations.   
- [Distance to early childare centers and attendance rates](github.com/LosCAPPos/EarlyEducationProject) (2024 | Python): Project to analyze the importance of distance to the closest early education center at a census tract level, and (ii) an optimization model to assess where to locate new early education centers based on impact in distances. My contributions included calculating distances from each census tract in Chicago to the closest childcare center (using Google API), geospatial data analysis (spatial joins) and data visualization. 

Some repos for school projects are private to follow academic honesty policies. Code for any of these is available on request:
